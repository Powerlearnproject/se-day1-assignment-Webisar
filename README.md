Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Just like a cook prepares a meal from a recipe, sotware engineering refers to the process of writing instructions for purpose of designing applications that are intended to solve real-world problems. Software engineering has been of help in education sector, health and commerce on a number of issues.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Introduction of programming languages such as Fortran, C, javascript, HTML and CSS. Secondly, establishment of software engineering as a field of study to enrisch the industry and finally, the advent of structural programming 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Identifying the requirements of the application from the users, secondly, designing an accurate architecture and userfriendly interface. Then, implement the code to check it's functionality.The next stage is testing how it works so that it is very good during deployment. It is then supposed to be maintained through updates and many others.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is an approach of modelling a design through steps starting from the most complex to the easiest whereas agile methodology is handling models in peers so that many people take different tasks.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing the code, a quality assurance engineer tests the authenticity of the code provided by the former. Meanwhile, a project manager is responsible for execution of the activities of the developer and quality assurance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide environments for drafting commands that design a program. These include VS Code and RStudio. Version Control systems help in communication and storage of the code for examle Github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines is one of the most outstanding, however, peer working may be just another solution to overcome such. Additionaly, requirements may change overtime for the design of the software required, in this case though, one has to be flexible and prepare for such isssues.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing looks at the components of the software, integration delves into subsystems, system looks at the entire system. Acceptance focuses on how it comforms with user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This could be narrowed down to the procedure of drafting questions with a purpose of getting efficient responses from AI. This helps in guiding one to get clear, concise and precise feedback from the chatbot

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Explain about animals
Improved    : Explain about aquatic animals
The improved is clear, specific and concise because the chatbot will now provide more clear information on a subject that is not very wide
